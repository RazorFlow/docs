RazorFlow Dashboard Framework Documentation
===========================================

We are currently migrating our documentation sources from our internal
repositories to public repositories. More information will be available
soon.

### How to build the documentation

You need to have node.js and npm installed to build the documentation.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/RazorFlow/docs.git
$ cd docs/
$ npm install
$ npm run-script devserver
$ grunt local_noapi
```

> Note: This is currently only supported on Mac OSX and Linux
> because of shell execution requirements, windows will be supported
> shortly
