Drill-downs allow your users to explore data by clicking on one item in your chart to reveal more data about the item that they have selected. For example, a drill-down might allow you to drill from Country-wide data to seeing data for an individual state. Drill-downs can also be used for navigating time-based records like drilling down from yearly data to monthly data.

Let's consider an example, where we're drilling from *Country* to *State* to *City*. We initially start off showing the *Country*-wide data, and once the user clicks on one country, it activates the next **drill step** which shows the states. Once the user clicks on the name of any sate, it activates a **drill step** which shows the cities in that state. Note that you would normally have to do a bit of filtering and aggregation but we will not be covering that here.

The basic concept here is to use the `addDrillStep` function to add one drill step at a time. Let's consider this basic skeleton of a chart:

~~~
var chart = new ChartComponent ();
chart.setCaption ("Sales by country");
chart.setLabels ([ /* list of countries */]);
chart.addSeries ("sales", "Sales", [ /* country-wise sales */]);

chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert ("Filtering states for country: " + params.label);
    chart.setLabels ([ /* List of states in the selected country */])
    chart.addSeries ("sales", "Sales", [ /* state-wise sales */])

    done (); // This is required
});

chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert ("Filtering states for state: " + params.label);
    chart.setLabels ([ /* List of cities in the selected state */])
    chart.addSeries ("sales", "Sales", [ /* city-wise sales */])

    done (); // This is required
});
~~~

#### Concept 1: Your chart data gets reset after every drill step

Notice that though you called `addSeries` every time in the drill step, it didn't add a new series, but rather replaced it. Technically, operating on a chart after a drill step is like working on a new chart object.

**Why is this happening?** When you are drilling down the chart, you normally show new data, with completely new labels and charts. This is similar to calling the {{ linkApi ("js", "ChartComponent", "clearChart")}} function.

#### Concept 2: You have to create a callback to handle the drill

Since the code to perform the drill down has to be done after the user clicks on a chart item, it needs to be specified as a JavaScript callback.

#### Concept 3: You have to call "done" at the end

Notice that there's a call to a function called `done` at the end of both drill step functions. This `done` function is also passed as the first parameter on the callback function.

**Why is this here?** If you have to perform some asynchronous functionality like fetching data using AJAX, you can call `done` only after the data is available, and the chart is ready for display.

#### Concept 4: The params include everything from onItemClick

The parameters of the item that was clicked on by the user are provided. 

* **value**: The value of the item that was clicked (purely numeric, this will not contain formatted values like number prefix/suffix, etc)
* **label**: The x-axis label that corresponds to the item that was clicked.
* **labelIndex**: The index of the label (starting from 0) that corresponds to the item that was clicked.

## Additional notes

### Get Drill data from server using AJAX

~~~
chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    $.ajax({
        url: "/get_data?country=" + encodeURI(params.label)
        success: function (data) {
            // Update the component with new data
            done(); // now finish the drill down
        }
    })
});
~~~

Notice how the `done` function can be called inside the AJAX success function

### Get values of previous drill 

For example, while filtering cities, you might need to perform a query which also knows the country and state. In other words, you need to know the entire history of the drilldown. For this, the `params` object includes a separate key called `drillLabelList`. 

chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert ("Filtering states for state: " + params.label);
    alert ("The country is: " + params.drillLabelList [0]); // drillLabelList is now ["Country", "State"]
    chart.setLabels ([ /* List of cities in the selected state */])
    chart.addSeries ("sales", "Sales", [ /* city-wise sales */])

    done (); // This is required
});
