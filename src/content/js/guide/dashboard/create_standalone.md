### Create a dashboard from the included dashboard template

1. Download RazorFlow, which is a ZIP file and extract it on your computer.
2. In the `razorflow_js` extracted directory, locate a folder called `dashboard_quickstart`.
3. Make a copy of this folder somewhere else and rename it as required.
4. Open `index.html` inside your browser.
5. Open the `dashboard_app.js` inside your text editor.
6. Configure your dashboard inside `dashboard_app.js`

The type of the dashboard you are creating is called a "Standalone Dashboard". We will cover the different types of dashboards in a later article.
