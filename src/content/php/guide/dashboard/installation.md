### Things you need before installing Dashboards for PHP

1. A web server running on Windows, or Linux, or OSX.
   
   If you don't have a web server installed, RazorFlow highly recommends XAMPP which is available for Windows, Linux and OSX. RazorFlow officially supports Apache 2 at this time of writing. Instructions for other web servers including IIS, nginx, lighttpd, Cherokee will be added soon.

2. PHP 5.3 (or above) installed and configured on your web server. 

### Installing on a local computer for development

1. [Download](http://razorflow.com/download/) as a zip file.
2. Determine the Document Root. The Document Root is the folder on your computer, where all your web pages are located.
3. Unzip the contents of the downloaded ZIP File somewhere inside your document root. A Single directory rf is created.
